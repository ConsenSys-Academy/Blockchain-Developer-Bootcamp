    <h2 id="future-considerations">Future Considerations</h2>
<p>As this course launches, on September 2021, there have been some interesting developments towards an Eth1-Eth2 merge. We'll discuss a few of these here. Please note, this may change as it is currently be developed!</p>
<p>First, there is a <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"mainnet readiness"</a> checklist the Ethereum developers will be using to judge when the time is right for an Eth1-Eth2 merge.</p>
<p>Here's the rough timeline given by Tim Beiko in August 2021:</p>
<p><img alt="Rough timeline for Eth1-Eth2 merge" src="../../img/S10/eth2-merge-timeline.png" /></p>
<p>There's also been talk of using rollups as a way to help with the Merge. Essentially, the L2s will function as a sort of shard-like data layer. You can read more about that <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<h2 id="rayonism-network">Rayonism Network</h2>
<p>In March 2021, as part of ETHGlobal Scaling hackathon, a group of Ethereum 2.0 developers tried to create a merge testnet. Known as <a href="https://rayonism.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rayonism,</a> it was meant as a short-term proof of concept project to allow researchers to test certain assumptions being made about the Eth1-Eth2 merge. One of the features it meant to test was the notion of <b>time,</b> a particularly challenging issue with distributed networks, as we discussed earlier in the course.</p>
<p>The Rayonism testnet did run for a short period of time. You can checkout the Merge testnet tutorial they ran <a href="https://github.com/protolambda/mergenet-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (although it most likely will not work now!)</p>
