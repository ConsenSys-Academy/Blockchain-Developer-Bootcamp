  <h1>Additional Material: Upgradable Contracts</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>We wanted to provide another example of an upgradable contract pattern. This pattern uses a separate contract to act as storage to another contract that contains the logic, also known as a "proxy delegate pattern". When you upgrade a contract, all your state is still in the old contract address. Therefore, we say the contract has "Eternal Storage."</p>
    <p>To avoid upgrades to the storage contract it should be as flexible as possible, by using several mappings for each data type where hashes are used as keys (only <code>uint</code> is shown in the example below):</p>

    <pre>
address owner = msg.sender;
address latestVersion;
mapping(bytes32 => uint) uIntStorage;
function upgradeVersion(address _newVersion) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    latestVersion = _newVersion;
}

function getUint(bytes32 _key) external view returns(uint) {
    return uIntStorage[_key];
}

function setUint(bytes32 _key, uint _value) external {
    require(msg.sender == latestVersion);
    uIntStorage[_key] = _value;
}

function deleteUint(bytes32 _key) external {
    require(msg.sender == latestVersion);
    delete uIntStorage[_key];
}
    </pre>

    <p>Each mapping should be manipulated by three functions: store, retrieve and delete. Use the access control pattern to allow only the most recent version of the logic contract to use the "eternal storage."</p>
