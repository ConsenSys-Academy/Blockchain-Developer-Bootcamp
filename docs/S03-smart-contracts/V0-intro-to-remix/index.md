In this video, we'll introduce you to [Remix,](https://remix.ethereum.org/) the Integrated Development Environment ([IDE](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-ide)) for Solidity and Ethereum development maintained by [the Ethereum Foundation.](https://ethereum.org/en/) Smart contract and decentralized application development requires a number of pieces such as compilers, testnets, accounts and more. Remix has all those tools and allows you to work on smart contract code in your browser.

Remix is not ideal for production-use code. However, it is a nice stepping stone as you learn more about smart contracts, Solidity, and developer tooling for the blockchain.

*Please note that the interface for Remix has changed over the past few years. Older tutorials may not look like the same Remix.*
