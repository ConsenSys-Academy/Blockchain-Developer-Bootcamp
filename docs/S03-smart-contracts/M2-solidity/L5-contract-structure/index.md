# Contract structure

**Note:** At the timestamp 2m00s, the video shows that a **contract constructor** can be defined by using the same name as the contract (in this case, "SimpleStorage"). **This is syntax has been deprecated as of Solidity version 0.5.0** and now the keyword constructor **must** be used.
