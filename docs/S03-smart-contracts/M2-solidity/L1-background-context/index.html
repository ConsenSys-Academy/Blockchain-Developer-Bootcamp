    <p>Solidity is "an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts...programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state” (<a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). While a few smart contract programming languages have developed over the years, Solidity remains the most dominant one.</p>

    <p>As we mentioned earlier, Solidity is a higher-order language meaning that the code deployed with a smart contract is not Solidity, but rather EVM bytecode. Solidity is an abstraction on top of that fundamental language so we don't have to be writing code that looks like this:

    <pre>
  PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0xE PUSH1 0x0 
  SSTORE CALLVALUE DUP1 ISZERO PUSH1 0x14 JUMPI 
  PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP PUSH1 0x35 
  DUP1 PUSH1 0x22 PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY PUSH1 0x0 
  RETURN INVALID PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 
  0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG1 PUSH6 0x627A7A723058 
  KECCAK256 RETURNDATASIZE 0x25 0xb6 0xcf CALLDATALOAD 
  LOG1 DUP16 PUSH9 0x27AC943141CFD6D0FA MSTORE SHL 
  DUP6 LOG4 PUSH8 0x7FADA153CC03D771 BLOCKHASH 0xb3 
  STOP 0x29
    </pre>

    But, rather code that looks like this:

    <pre>
  pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.9.0;

  contract MyContract {
      uint i = 10 + 2 * 2;
  }
    </pre>

    While both these blocks of code describe the same operation, the second version (Solidity) is much easier to read and write.

    <h2>General Characteristics of Solidity</h2>
      <p>Solidity uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECMAScript</a> syntax like Javascript, to make it approachable for web developers. However, do not be lulled into complacency! Solidity is much more demanding in its requirements.</p>

      <p>Some of Solidity's basic characteristics:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Case Sensitive</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Statement termination via a semicolon <code>;</code></b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Files use the <code>.sol</code> extension</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Statically typed</b> Types need to be known at compile time. This makes Solidity more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Typescript</a> than Javascript in practice.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Various compilation options</b> Solidity compiling can be done on the command line by <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solc</a>, you can compile it in a web-browser using <a href="http://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remix,</a> or compile it as part of a smart contract development framework like <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truffle</a> or <a href="https://www.hardhat.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardhat</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compiles down to EVM bytecode</b> Which then runs within the Ethereum Virtual Machine when deployed to a network</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Overall, the Solidity workflow can be illustrated as follows:

      </p>

      <p>In this section, we're going to go over the basic conventions of Solidity. We're also going to start building smart contracts and discussing their general structure and design patterns.</p>

      <p>We can't emphasize this enough: smart contract coding is both really exciting and really dangerous! We see smart contracts <code><a href="https://rekt.news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rekt</a></code> every day! We want to both give you all the tools to both build with creativity <i>and</i> confidence. Let's go!</p>
