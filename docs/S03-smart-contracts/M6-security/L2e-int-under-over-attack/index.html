    <h1>Integer Over / Underflow</h1>

    <p><b>Note: Due to SafeMath being included in Solidity 0.8.x, the likelihood of you writing an integer under or overflow is extremely unlikely. However, a number of contracts still exist with this attack vector and it's good to know about. But, again, the inclusion of SafeMath helps significantly protect against this attack vector.</b></p>

    <p>This contract shows what an integer overflow vulnerability (<a href="https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-101" target="_blank">SWC-101</a>) looks like.</p>
  
    <p>In this VulnerableContract the lockTime is manipulable by the currentInvestor. The maximum value for the lockTime is 4294967295 because it is declared type uint32 (and 2^32 = 4294967296). If the currentInvestor attempts to set the value above&nbsp;4294967295, it will overflow and start counting back at 0.</p>

    <p>
      <br>This type of attack is easily avoidable by using <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol" target="_blank">a SafeMath library such as this</a>, that provides safety checks and will revert on error. The SafeMath library <a href="https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now ships</a> with Solidity as of 0.8.x, so you do not have to include it if you're working with a compiler on 0.8.x except in very specific cases mentioned <a href="S03-smart-contracts/M6-security/L2e-int-under-over-attack/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
