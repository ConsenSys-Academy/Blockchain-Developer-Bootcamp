For a comprehensive, maintained list of smart contract weaknesses, along with test cases and examples of vulnerable smart contracts, check out theÂ [SWC Registry](https://swcregistry.io/){target=\_blank}. This is a community maintained project and includes most, if not all of the well known vulnerabilities and hacks, with contract samples and suggestions for how to address weaknesses.
