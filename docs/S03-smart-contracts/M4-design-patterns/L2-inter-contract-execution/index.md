# Inter-contract execution: Part 1

In this video, we're going to see how a contract can inherit variables from another contract. The code in the video is `pragma 0.5.x`, but [the contract](https://gist.github.com/ConsenSys-Academy/be7dacf4d313ea4c1347638e921541b5){target=\_blank} compiles with `0.8.x` as well.
