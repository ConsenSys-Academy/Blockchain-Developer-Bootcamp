  Sending Transactions
====================

  We're created an [interactive Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@consensys-academy/externally-owned-accounts-and-ethereum-transactions){target=_blank} to learn more about Externally Owned Accounts signing and sending transactions into the network. [You can find the tutorial here.](https://observablehq.com/@consensys-academy/externally-owned-accounts-and-ethereum-transactions){target=_blank}

 If the notebook doesn't operate properly or you get the error Web3js = SecurityError: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window': Access is denied for this document. you will need to enable third party cookies.  
 This varies from browser to browser.
