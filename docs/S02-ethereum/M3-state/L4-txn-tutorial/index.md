# Sending Transactions

We've created an [interactive Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@consensys-academy/externally-owned-accounts-and-ethereum-transactions){target=\_blank} to learn more about Externally Owned Accounts signing and sending transactions into the network. [You can find the tutorial here](https://observablehq.com/@consensys-academy/externally-owned-accounts-and-ethereum-transactions){target=\_blank}.

If the notebook doesn't operate properly or you get the error - _Web3js = SecurityError: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window': Access is denied for this document._ - you will need to enable third party cookies.  
This varies from browser to browser.
