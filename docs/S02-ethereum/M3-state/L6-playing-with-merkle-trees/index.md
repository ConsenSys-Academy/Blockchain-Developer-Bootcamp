  Playing with Merkle Trees
=========================

  To learn more about Merkle Trees, we've made [an Observable Notebook you can find here.](https://observablehq.com/@consensys-academy/merkle-trees) Follow along with the tutorial to better understand the code structure of this data structure.

 Additional Material

 * [Video: Merkle Roots, Merkle Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUwXCt1qkBU)
* [Wikipedia: Merkle Trees,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) [Merkle Patricia Tree,](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/patricia-tree) [Radix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)
* [Interactive Code: Binary Trees](http://btholt.github.io/four-semesters-of-cs/) Scroll down to "Binary Search Tree," this is more general computer science!
* [Code Tutorial: Implement A Binary Search Tree](https://initjs.org/implement-a-binary-search-tree-in-javascript-952a44ee7c26) Again, another general computer science tutorial, simply meant to give you an understanding of tree data structures and how machines read and write to them.
