--rewrite simpler: we want to:
1) teach from first principles
2) show how developments emerge at scale
2) onboard you to programming in a helpful, productive way

--this protects against a few things:
1) what if blockchain is all hype?
2) rapid pace of change
3) blockchain is a passing pleasure after Javascript but before machine learning 

  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  
    <p>
      
      Hello and welcome to ConsenSys Academy’s Blockchain Developer Bootcamp, 
      where you will learn everything you need to know to become a world-class 
      blockchain developer. 
    
    </p>
      
    <p>

      The blockchain field develops at an incredibly fast pace. [MORE HERE ABOUT WHAT THE RAPID PACE REQUIRES FROM DEVELOPERS, IE continous onboarding] 
      
      This course will give you a solid foundation of blockchain principles. It will also introduce you to the tools used to build blockchain projects today.  
      

      It can be overwhelming to enter such a rapidly developing field.      
    
      

        
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With that in mind, this course aims to teach from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#Aristotle's_contribution">a first principles approach.</a>

      We hope this gives you a deeper understanding of the material that can accommodate the rapid
      change occurring in the blockchain world.
