The second step in creating a peer-to-peer trust protocol system is to digitally confirm the integrity of a file using mathematics. This ensures no one has tampered with a file. This video discusses how we use cryptographic hash functions to achieve this.


*This introductory material also appears in our Blockchain Essentials course. While we will be going into much deeper technical detail, this is meant to give you an overview of the cryptographic hash functions.*
