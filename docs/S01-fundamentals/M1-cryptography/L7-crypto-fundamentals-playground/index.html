  <h1>Cryptography Fundamentals Playground</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

  <p>If you've gotten this far, you've learned the basic cryptographic fundamentals underpinning blockchain generally. We still need to learn about decentralized consensus, and we'll do that in the next module, but we wanted to let you interact with public key cryptography, hash functions and digital signing in a tangible way.</p>

  <p>We'll have a live presentation where we walk through playing with  cryptographic keys and generating accounts. In the meanwhile, please check out the resources below. These are advanced exercises, but we hope you will at least take a look. If these look too intense, that's also okay.</p>

    <!-- <p>If you've gotten this far, you've learned the basic cryptographic fundamentals underpinning blockchain generally.

    <b>⚠️ Please note that all the cryptography you will be doing in this section is for <i>EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY</i>. any private keys you generate and migrate in this section should not be used to hold <i>ANY</i> amount of cryptocurrency! ⚠️</b> 

    <p>The next section will walk you through two main exercises. The first will be a way to generate as many digital private keys as you'd like, use those keys to sign a message, and then authenticate that message using the associated public key. The second will be a toy example of a hash chain, where you can generate a certain number of blocks in a hash chain, change the information in one of the blocks, and see the entire chain fail.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>In addition to this crypto playground, we're also going to direct you to some places where you can learn more about applied cryptography and encryption. These are advanced exercises, but we hope you will at least take a look. If these look too intense, that's also okay. You can proceed to the next section and play in our crypto playground, which is very nice and fun.</p> -->

    <li><a href="https://github.com/cooganb/bitcoin-whitepaper-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin White Paper Exercises</a> These are a series of exercises, built by <a href="https://github.com/getify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Simpson,</a> for understanding some of the concepts outlined in the Bitcoin white paper. These are not easy, but if you really would like to understand these fundamentals as they apply to blockchains, this is a great place to start.</li>

    <li><a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack the Box</a> A gamified, cybersecurity platform. Not cryptography, per se, but cyber security which is a related field.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptopals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CryptoPals</a> This is <i>very</i> advanced and intense, but real to-the-metal applied cryptography! I am putting this link in here and it scares me.</li>
