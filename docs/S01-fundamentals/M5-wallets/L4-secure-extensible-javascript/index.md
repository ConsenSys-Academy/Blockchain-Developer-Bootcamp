This talk is by Dan Finley, MetaMask lead and was first given internally for ConsenSys.

In this talk, Dan walks us through some of the tools that MetaMask is using to make new experiences possible. Learn about what works today, and where these tools are headed. Whether or not you write JavaScript, you'll leave with a concept of what a scalable distributed extensible system could look like in the future.
