<h2 id="when-to-use-which-tool">When to use which tool</h2>
<p>Have a large order? Use <a href="https://www.airswap.io/" target="_blank">AirSwap</a> and go deep.</p>
<p>It’s great for larger trades to protect margins and protect against a kind of front running called <a href="https://hackmd.io/ivUzk3piQEG8ALzCGbxlag" target="_blank">"miner extracted value"</a>. This is because trades are direct between traders, so there is no slippage or public information to the front-run orders.</p>
<p>Need liquidity? Use an Automated Market Maker like UniSwap and go wide.</p>
<p>It’s great for variety and availability. But, ideally, aim for smaller trades to anything under 2% of the total supply of an asset. This is due to how the "Constant Product Formula" used by AMMs is modelled to ensure liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Use the appropriate tool based on the size of your order.</p>
<p>RFQ facilities direct trade between parties which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair - avoids the <a href="https://decrypt.co/42839/inside-the-mysterious-world-of-bitcoins-mempool" target="_blank">mempool</a> and issues around Front running, and miner extractable value.</li>
<li>Efficient - Eliminates slippage, so you get what you paid for.</li>
<li>Scalable - negotiations happen off-chain (not on Ethereum) and scales better than relying solely on Ethereum’s throughput.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Request for Quote handles trades with off-chain negotiations and on-chain settlement (trades){target=_blank}. Market makers are called Makers who run servers to fulfil orders. Counterparties to makers are called Takers, who wish to trade tokens.</p>
<p>RFQ can be seen as a peer-to-peer system. The protocol’s smart contracts focus on on-chain settlement of trades via "atomic" swaps using smart contracts. Price discovery and negotiation are made off-chain via RPC (remote procedure calls){target=_blank}, which is scalable and resistant to AMM issues related to front running and miner extractable value.</p>
<p>This model exists because of Ethereum’s constraints and the issues around large orders on AMMs mentioned previously.</p>
<h2 id="supplying-liquidity">Supplying Liquidity</h2>
<p>Liquidity is provided by Makers who run <a href="https://docs.airswap.io/guides/makers" target="_blank">Servers</a>. These servers are discoverable via the <a href="https://docs.airswap.io/technology/discovery" target="_blank">Registry Protocol</a> which allows for price discovery.</p>
<p>Makers submit their prices to trade. Takers are counterparties who wish to start a trade.</p>
<p>Instead of talking to each Maker, the Taker sends a request to the Indexer, who aggregates the different Makers for Takers.</p>
<p>This negotiation is done off-chain via RPC (remote procedure calls), making it resistant to flashbots searching the mempool for frontrunning opportunities, Miner Extractable Value and other shenanigans.</p>
<p><img alt="airswap indexer flow" src="../../../img/S05/airswap-indexer-flow.png" /></p>
<h2 id="price-discovery-and-verification">Price Discovery and Verification</h2>
<p>Makers can consult with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/" target="_blank">Oracles</a> to consider a fair price suggestion. Takers can also consult with Oracles to ensure the price given is a good deal.</p>
<p><img alt="airswap-oracle-flow" src="../../../img/S05/airswap-oracle-flow.png" /></p>
<h2 id="liquidity-via-delegates">Liquidity via Delegates</h2>
<p>If standing up a Server is too much, a Maker could use <a href="https://medium.com/fluidity/introducing-airswap-delegates-1c3db83be1db" target="_blank">Delegates</a>. Delegates enable any trader to add rules that specify the size and price for a particular token, which can be used as limit orders. The added benefit is that the trader doesn’t lose custody of their tokens when doing so.</p>
<h2 id="orders-and-settlement">Orders and Settlement</h2>
<p>Once discovery and off-chain negotiation are complete, the orders are settled on-chain.</p>
<p>This is done via <a href="https://support.airswap.io/en/articles/2455935-what-is-an-atomic-swap" target="_blank">atomic swaps</a> using a Swap contract. They are called atomic because they settle or they don’t.</p>
<p>The added benefit of this is that compared to order books, off-chain negotiation makes it more likely that orders will be filled once they are accepted. It helps to eliminate slippage and front running.</p>
