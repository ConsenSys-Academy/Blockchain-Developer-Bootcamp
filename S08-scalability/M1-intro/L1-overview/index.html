<p>Ethereum gas fees have risen astronomically as the network becomes more popular. The ability of retail investors to participate in new Ethereum-based offerings like DeFi is circumscribed by the ever-increasing cost of entry into the space. </p>
<p>Three main challenges presented by the success of mainnet Ethereum:
1. Spiking gas costs <b>price-out market share and impact user experience.</b> Best case is loss of low-value transactions and poor UX due to stuck transactions. Worst case is compromising healthy market operation like <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/what-really-happened-to-makerdao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Thursday.</a>
2. <b>Block Latency</b> is problematic in some applications
3. Pushing gas costs to users creates friction and impacts user experience. User has to navigate rather <b>complex effects.</b></p>
<p>As a result, some users and products are migrating to other chains that offer lower costs. Off-chain scaling is capable of solving these problems by providing higher throughput, faster state advancement and gas cost abstraction. It can be transformative for application UX</p>
<p>State advancement (propagating new network state) is 10-100x faster (the rate at which data can be updated on-chain). Reducing user feedback loop from 12s to &lt;1s. High frequency transactions possible (e.g. high-fidelity price oracles, rapid orderbook management)</p>
<p>Transactions are a fraction of the cost. Low or no-value transactions viable
Support for native gas cost abstraction, meta-transactions, account abstraction. Subsidised gas, or gas cost is paid in relevant tokens. Better native support for smart contract wallets and features like social recovery.</p>
<p>If Ethereum is to maintain its dominance and network effect, it must scale. </p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>In the following sections, we're first going to go through some of the <em>types</em> of Layer 2 solutions. Then walk through examples of popular Layer 2 solutions. We're then going to talk about crosschain and blockchain interoperability. Finally, we're going to have live sessions and presentations based around L2 platforms such as Polygon, Optimism and more.</p>
<p>In this section, we'll typically refer to mainnet Ethereum as Layer 1 or L1 and whatever the scaling solution is as a Layer 2 solution (L2), a sidechain, sidechannel or a bridge.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are exciting and very new topics, please be aware that they are considered <em>very</em> cutting edge and you should be extremely careful when using them. Also, please know that the documentation changes very regularly and perhaps not perceptibly. If you're currently building on a Layer 2 solution, we recommend joining the project's Discord, or wherever the community gathers, and making sure to follow their developer updates.</p>
<p>Let's dive in!</p>
