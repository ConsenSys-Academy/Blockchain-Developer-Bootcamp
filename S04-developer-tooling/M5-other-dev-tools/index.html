    <h1 id="other-development-tools">Other Development Tools</h1>
<p><i>Before we dive into these other development frameworks, we wanted to provide an "offramp" to folks who may not be comfortable with JavaScript Frameworks. We'd encourage you to check out the sections on Node and JavaScript Frameworks in the Basic Training course. People uncomfortable with terminal-based development might be interested in <a href="https://github.com/kitze/JSUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSUI,</a> a GUI-based JavaScript framework development environment. You can also checkout some frontend boilerplate projects <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/useful-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></i></p>
<h2 id="hardhat">Hardhat</h2>
<p>Another popular development framework is <a href="https://hardhat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardhat,</a> which actually started as a fork of Truffle. It has since grown to create its own suite of tools and a devoted community.</p>
<p>Hardhat divides itself into "tasks" and "plugins". Running <code>npx hardhat compile</code> is a task, for example. <a href="https://hardhat.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plugins</a> are extended functionality ported into Hardhat. <a href="https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-gas-reporter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas Reporter</a> and 
<a href="https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-contract-sizer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contract Sizer</a> are two popular plugins for Hardhat. </p>
<p>Why choose Hardhat? Some feel as though the command-line experience of Hardhat is faster than Truffle. Others like the extensive plugin features. One feature popular with Hardhat developers is their use of <code>console.log()</code> in smart contracts. When developing locally with Hardhat, you can import the <code>console.sol</code> contract, like so:</p>
<pre>
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Token {
  //...
}</pre>

<p>You can then add it to your contract when developing it locally:</p>
<pre>
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    console.log("Sender balance is %s tokens", balances[msg.sender]);
    console.log("Trying to send %s tokens to %s", amount, to);

    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens");

    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
}</pre>

<p>Which gives you this output when running locally on the Hardhat Network:</p>
<pre>
$ npx hardhat test

  Token contract
    Deployment
      ✓ Should set the right owner
      ✓ Should assign the total supply of tokens to the owner

      ✓ Should fail if sender doesn’t have enough tokens

<p>You can learn more about this feature in their documentation <a href="https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/#console-log" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are some easy ways to get started using Hardhat to see how you like it:
- <a href="https://hardhat.org/tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardhat's Beginner Tutorial and Project Setup</a>
- <a href="https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardhat Development Network</a>
- <a href="https://hardhat.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Index of Reusable Plugins</a></p>
<p>The Hardhat teams recommends "paying attention to see whether any plugins already solve problems [you] may have."</p>
<h2 id="scaffold-eth">Scaffold-ETH</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaffold-ETH</a> (<a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a>) is a project from prolific builder Austin Griffith meant to minimize the time between thinking of a decentralized app idea and deploying it to the world.</p>
<p>However, Scaffold-ETH requires an advanced comfortability with tools like Yarn, Solidity, Hardhat, React, etc. It's best for folks who already have a very solid Web 2 or Web 3 workflow. For those folks, Scaffold-ETH is jet fuel! <b>Please note, however, that projects and tutorials in Scaffold-ETH have not been audited in any way and may contain bugs or vulnerabilities!</b></p>
<p>In the repo, Austin has provided a number of forks that correspond to different template projects or tutorials. Read more about the tutorials and examples <a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/examples-and-tutorials/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>As we mentioned, Scaffold-ETH by default serves up a <a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/react-app-1/untitled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React App,</a> with pre-built components, and hooks. It's also incorporated a third-party UI library called <a href="https://ant.design/components/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ant Design</a> to help with the designing of components. It also incorporates <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surge,</a> a static-site generator to publish your app.</p>
<p>Scaffold-ETH also has significant <a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/infraestructure/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infrastructure support</a> for the later parts of the development cycle, such as The Graph, Tenderly, Etherscan, and L2/Sidechain Services (deploying to Optimism and Arbitrum).</p>
<p>Also, there are <a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/examples-and-tutorials/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examples</a> from some great projects in the space, like Aave, The Graph, Chainlink, Optimism and Uniswap. You can also <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth#-buidl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn</a> about common design patterns such as commit-reveal, ecrecover, multisigs, DEXes, and more!</p>
<p>Last, Austin is an incredibly proflific creator of content, including support videos and walkthroughs of Scaffold-ETH. Below are some recent walkthroughs he's done:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="brownie">Brownie</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, <a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie" target="_blank">Brownie</a> is a Python-based development and testing framework for smart contracts running on the EVM. It uses <a href="https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Web3.py</a> as well as Solidity. It is most well-known for being the development framework the <a href="https://yearn.finance" target="_blank">Yearn.Finance</a> team uses to build their powerful DeFi platform and <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/curve-dao-token--crv-" target="_blank">CRV.</a></p>
<p>Brownie definitely takes some notes from Truffle (they are both "sweet"){target=_blank}, including having a <code>brownie init</code> command and their equivalent of Truffle boxes, <a href="https://github.com/brownie-mix" target="_blank">"Brownie Mixes."</a> This makes it an easy tool for a lot of Truffle developers familiar with Truffle.</p>
<p>Here are some tutorials to introduce you to Brownie:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="tenderly">Tenderly</h2>
<p><a href="https://tenderly.co/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenderly</a> provides a way to both be alerted to contract events as well as troubleshoot a contract, including a "Forking Mainnet" feature similar to that of Truffle and Hardhat.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-tools">Frontend Tools</h2>
<p>For your project, we've also discussed frontend interfaces. There are two services you can use for free to create a frontend instance easily:
- <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a> is a Platform-as-a-Service, providing a quick way to deploy apps in a number of popular languages, such as Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Ruby and Go.  You can connect your GitHub repo to your project for easy deployment. Heroku's basic plan is free and provides basic resources for getting started. <a href="https://www.heroku.com/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more here.</a>
- <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> also has a Git-based workflow allowing you to deploy your project easily from GitHub. It is also free and has a getting started manual <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>There are so many more amazing tools that we can't get into now, but if you check out the links in this section, you'll be able to dive deeper and learn more on your own!</p>
